<h1>Database</h1>
The Database object is the first thing constructed by the application.

A database consists of:
<li>A managed shared memory region which is shared by all processes which open the database.</li>
<li>A transactional infrastructure</li>
<li>One or more "Containers", which are stored within the database by name, and manipulated transactionally.</li>

<h2>Opening a Database</h2>

A Database is opened via a constructor.  The constructor automatically performs any appropriate and/or necessary
actions to get the process attached to the database.   There are different constructors which can limit the action taken.
What occurs during construction will typically fall into one of 3 categories.
<li>Creating the database from scratch, including creating new initial instances of all containers in the database.</li>
<li>Attaching to the existing shared memory region, and reacquiring handles to the existing containers</li>
<li>Recovering the database by creating or destroying and recreating the shared memory region for the Database, 
and creating new instances of the containers within it.  Then loading the containers using the data in the 
checkpoints and logs to rebuild the contents of the shared region.</li>

Note that "Recovery", as it is referred to hereafter, applies in multiple circumstances.  It can apply simply because 
the shared memory region of the database no longer exists for some reason.  As a result, the Database constructor
must recreate it, and the containers within it, and then load the containers from their last checkpoint.

Alternatively, recovery might be needed because the registry determines that some process terminated while
accessing the database.  Under such circumstances, the region might be corrupt, process shared mutexes
might still be locked by the dead process, so recovery is needed.  In that case, the existing region is destroyed, 
and a new one is created to take its place.  This recovers the database from any form of error which has not
made it into the checkpoint or log files.

Either way, recovery processing consists of the same steps:
<li>Any existing region is marked invalid, and removed.  Removing the region causes any existing region that
processes ae attached to to become an anonymous region that the OS reclaims once they release it.  It does not
cause the region to immediately 'vanish' causing SEGVs in those processes.  The marking of the region as invalid
ensures that no further transactional writes, or checkpoints, by processes connected to that region will occur.</li>
<li>A new region is created from scratch, and the container instances within the region are all recreated<li>
<li>Each container's contents are reloaded from the latest checkpoint file.</li>
<li>All log entries which have a transaction_id after the checkpoint transaction_id are applied against the containers
to restore them fully to their last comitted (logged) transaction<li>

Once open, the mehods of the Database object allow a process to get handles to the containers within the database,
and also start transactions against the database for the manipulation of those containers.

<h1>The Database Registry</h1>

During the process of opening the Database, the process first checks the registry to determine if the
managed shared memory region is valid.  The registry consists of a vector<pid_t> which identifies all
processes that have connected to the Database, and have not yet disconnected normally.

In addition, for each connected pid, there is a list of transactions.  The transactions in this list are all
those which have made at least one pending change to the Databse, and not yet been comitted.

While this information is kept up to date by well behaved processes, if a process dies, it will not have
removed itself or its transactions from these data structures.  That then identifies that the region may
have some corruption in it.

To determine if the processes are running, each process which is registered in the pid list also
acquires a file lock (some lock which has process scope) against a specific resource (named after the pid).

So to check the registry for the need for recovery, a new process just connects to the Database record,
and then gets the list of pid_t in the registery.  For each pid_t, it checks to see that the process still has
its expected file lock.  If the file lock is no longer held, then the that pid is assumed to have terminated.
If the pid then has in-progress write transactions, recovery is needed.  If it has no write transactions
in progress, the entry of the dead process is simply cleaned up.  If it has in-progress write transactions
then recovery is needed.

Note that the regstry itself is not really protected against possible corruption.
